    <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
    <P>Hello! My name is Emily, but I often go by my username Animatingdragon online. I've been drawing since i was in kindergarden, but i've been focusing more on art and animation since around 2017. My favourite thing to draw is Dragons and cats.</P>
		<p>The reason I have been focusing on art recently is for the enjoyment of making a coherant art peice that looks decent. My favourite step of the drawing process is shading, I like to shade. I chose the username "Animatingdragon" as well, i enjoy both animating and dragons. </p>
